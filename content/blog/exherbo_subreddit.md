I am delighted to announce the opening of the **unofficial Exherbo subreddit**[^1]!
You can discuss topic relavant to the distro, take up any problem that you have
encountered or share your thoughts and setups.

Note that Exherbo development take place on our _Gitlab instance_[^3] and the
critical discussions still happen on _#exherbo_ IRC channel on _Freenode_[^4].

Furthermore, distro documentation[^5] is currently under reorganisation and we
encourage you to open an _issue_ (or even better a _Merge Request_!) telling us
which parts you donâ€™t find and which parts are hard to grasp.

**Stay tuned** for more Exherbo development in 2019, like the introduction of _66_ init and rc
manager[^6].
