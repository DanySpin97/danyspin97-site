This is the preface for a series of post on terminal apps, called **Termish**.

But *why*?

I love staying in the terminal. A lot of things are faster to do and I don't
have to move my hands away from keyboard every now and then.

The problem is: we don't always have the right tool to use.
Plus, a lot of goodies don't have visibility.
We will explore these programs covering a great range of
categories, including a usage example for each one.

As an _Exherbo_ user, all the programs discussed will be available, so you can
test them out. Also, fellow users will add these packages in _Gentoo_ and
_Sabotage_. I bet that the _AUR_ already have them all.

Please, feel free to comment and to propose apps on _Mastodon_ and _Reddit_,
where all the articles will be posted.

In the meanwhile...take this nyancat.
